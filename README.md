# Othello Game Application

This is a full-stack **Othello (Reversi)** game developed using Java **Spring Boot** for the backend and **Java Swing** for the frontend. It supports **Single Player** (vs Computer) and **Multiplayer** modes.

---

## Project Details

- **Backend:** Java Spring Boot, Spring Security (JWT Authentication), Hibernate JPA, PostgreSQL
- **Frontend:** Java Swing (desktop GUI)
- **Authentication:** Secure login/registration using **BCrypt password hashing** and **JWT tokens**
- **Game Mechanics:** 
  - Play against a **Computer AI** (Basic / Intermediate / Advanced)
  - Play **Online Multiplayer** (via invite system)
  - **Wins-Losses-Draws** statistics are tracked
- **Deployment Ready:** Can be hosted with external Postgres DB and a lightweight Spring Boot server

## ðŸš€ How to Run Locally

1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Soham1605/othello.git
   cd othello

2. **Configure Database:**
   - Open src/main/resources/application.properties
   - Replace database username and password:
     ```bash
     spring.datasource.username=your_postgres_username
     spring.datasource.password=your_postgres_password

3. **Run Backend:**
    ```bash
     mvn spring-boot:run
 - Backend runs on http://localhost:8081

4. **Run Frontend:**
   - Run the Main class (com.othello.othello.ui.Main.java) to launch the Swing application.
  

## What you will see:
- **Login/Registration Screen:** Can register new credentials (username, password) and login with existing credentials. We use Java Web Tokens for Authorization.

- **Home Screen:** Can see the home screen for the application that allows user to play with computer/online and also shows Wins/Losses/Draws records

- **Play with Computer:** We can select difficulty between Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced.

  The logic used for these difficulty levels is relatively simple. The idea of playing Othello is to **capture the corners** before the other player can, while also trying to **capture most amount of flips**. The **Basic model** randomly selects its moves, the **Advanced model** will try to capture corner when it can and try to flip the most when it can't. The **Intermediate model** does both with 50% probability. A human can still beat all 3 levels of computer.

  This is an 8*8 board with black and white pieces arranged as shown. Black always plays first so the user is assigned black. The hollow circles indicate **valid** moves and the user must click on those circles.

  If the user selects a hollow circle out of turn, it won't be registered and the user will see this popup:

  Upon completion of game, game summary is shown as follows:

- **Play Online:** We can either create or join a game. This is an invite based multiplayer system and not a lobby. This means that a player creates a game, the backend provides a code that is shared to the other player by our user. The other user joins the game with the given code.

  Creating a game launches a code from the backend that must be shared by the user to the other player (via text or by word .etc)

  As the user wait for the other player to join the game, this is what he/she sees:

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d338a04-155b-4e44-9f23-e749847d7236)

  The other player enters the game by clicking Play Online -> Join Game -> and then he enters the shared invite code.

  The two windows indicate the boards of both players. The **user who creates the game is assigned Black** and always starts the game. The **user who joins is assigned White** and must follow. The usernames and the count of their corresponding pieces can be found at the top of the screen.

  The game status is the same for both players as the game progresses, with their corresponding valid moves shown to them.

  If a player plays out of turn, a popup tells them so.

  As the game ends, the game summary is shown as follows:

  Upon exiting from the boards, we go back to home window with **updated Wins/Losses/Draws ratios**. You will see that the user we just created has lost the game so his W/L/D ratio went from being 0/0/0 to 0/1/0.
